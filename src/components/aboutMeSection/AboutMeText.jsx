      <p>
        With a strong background in endpoint management and software
        development, I have developed and deployed PowerShell automation
        pipelines for patching, software distribution, and compliance reporting
        across 1000+ enterprise devices spanning Windows, Android, and iOS. My
        experience with SCCM and Microsoft Intune has equipped me to deliver
        scalable MDM/MAM solutions and implement secure, cloud-driven endpoint
        configurations. I have a proven track record of creating intuitive
        dashboards and reporting tools, combining backend logic and data
        presentationâ€”skills that seamlessly translate into full-stack web
        application development. I am well-versed in structured testing
        methodologies like IAT and UAT, following secure deployment practices
        that align closely with CI/CD workflows. Additionally, I have resolved
        production incidents (P2/P3) while maintaining SLA commitments through
        agile frameworks using ServiceNow and Jira, further strengthening my
        ability to troubleshoot and support modern, dynamic environments.
